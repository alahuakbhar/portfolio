        <p><strong>Over the next several</strong> years, humanoid robots will change the nature of work. Or at least,
            that’s what humanoid robotics companies have been consistently promising, enabling them to raise hundreds of
            millions of dollars at valuations that run into the billions.</p>

        <p>Delivering on these promises will require a lot of robots. Agility Robotics expects to ship “hundreds” of its
            Digit robots in 2025 and has a factory in Oregon capable of building over 10,000 robots per year. Tesla is
            planning to produce 5,000 of its Optimus robots in 2025, and at least 50,000 in 2026. Figure believes “there
            is a path to 100,000 robots” by 2029. And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly
            crowded space.</p>

        <p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: Bank of America Global Research, for example, predicts
            that global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And Morgan Stanley Research estimates
            that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p>

        <p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful
            companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects.
            And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable,
            efficient, and safe humanoid robot—which does not currently exist—might conceivably be able to do. Can the
            current reality connect with the promised scale?</p>
